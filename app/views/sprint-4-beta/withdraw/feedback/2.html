                End-point assessment organisations (EPAOs) must withdraw if they no longer want to assess a specific standard or be on the register of EPAOs.

            <p class="govuk-body">
                We need you to provide some information before you withdraw, so that we can work with you to support any learners.

                All withdrawals notifications must comply with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/conditions-for-being-on-the-register-of-end-point-assessment-organisations#orderly-withdrawal-from-the-register-of-end-point-assessment-organisations" target="_blank">conditions of acceptance (opens in a new tab or window)</a>.
