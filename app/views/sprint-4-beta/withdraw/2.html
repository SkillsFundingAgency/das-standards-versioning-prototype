                    End-point assessment organisations (EPAOs) must withdraw if they no longer want to assess a specific standard or be on the register of EPAOs.

                <p>
                    We need you to provide some information before you withdraw, so that we can work with you to support any learners.

                <p>
                    All withdrawals notifications must comply with the <a class="govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/conditions-for-being-on-the-register-of-end-point-assessment-organisations#orderly-withdrawal-from-the-register-of-end-point-assessment-organisations" target="_blank">conditions of acceptance (opens in a new tab or window)</a>.
